## QFISH Database Assignment

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtext)
```

For this assignment, I have selected the Otter Trawl fisheries database, looking at the number of licenses, days, and tonnes of catch by species and region.

```{r}
QFISH.otter.trawl <- read.csv("C:/Users/eanbr/Desktop/JCU Masters/Semester 3/MB5370 Techniques in Marine Science 1/github/mb5370/Data Science Module/data/QFISH.otter.trawl.csv")

qfish <- as_tibble(QFISH.otter.trawl)

qfish # As the default viewing width of tibbles is five columns, we do not need to adjust the viewing width for this dataset.
```
